2.1 Class definition (3 points)

Define a class called Blup, for a generic type T having two parameters x and y, providing two operations called fisto and fosto. fisto takes a value belonging to T and returns a value of type Maybe x, while fosto takes a value belonging to T and returns a value of type Maybe y.

2.2 Instance I (4 points)

Define the sum type Blargh with two parameters of types a and b. It has three data constructor: either Bip with two parameters of types respectively a and b, or Bop with only one parameter of type a, or Bup with no parameters.
Make Blargh an instance of class Blup, where fisto is used to access to data of type a, and fosto to data of type b.

2.3 Instance II (4 points)

Define the sum type Blarf with two parameters of types a and b. It has two data constructor: either La and a list of elements of type a, or Lb and a list of elements of type b.
Make Blarf an instance of class Blup, where fisto is used to access to the head of the list of elements of type a, and fosto to the head of the list of elements of type b.

2.4
1. Smap (6 points)

Define a function smap that takes an infinite list L of Int, a function f from Int to Int, an operation OP over Int, and a threshold T. smap performs a map of f on L, while keeping an accumulator K (with starting value 0), which is updated at each step as oldAccumulatorV alue OP f(currentElementOfL). smap stops when the value of K reaches T and returns a list of all the computed values of the map. 
E.g. smap (^2) (+) [1,2..] 100 is the list [1,4,9,16,25,36,49].

2. Write smapâ€™s type.
